## MasterThesis
Code used in my Master thesis with the title: "Demand Forecasting from sales data with the presence of stockouts".

The goal of the master thesis is to show how to do successful demand forecasting when you are facing a product that has frequent stockouts.
Stockouts can harm the forecast since they will give a false picture of the demand. Hence, regular forecasting techniques can not be applied, and various adjustments to the dataset are needed. Firstly, we need to approximate the demand during the stockout period, so we can then do the forecast on those adjusted data. I will test various methods on the sales data characterized by trend and seasonality, making the problem more complex.

For the purpose of this master thesis both Python and R are being used. 

Python is used in the first part to generate fake data which will have trend and seasonality. Furtherly, R is used for the approximation of demand during stockouts, forecasting, and error measurements. 

The dataset used in this master thesis can be found on my Kaggle profile: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kerimmasovic/fakesalesdata. This dataset is generated by Python and saved to Excel. 

This is how original data withstockouts looks like:

The generated sales data reflects an increasing trend over the years, alongside the presence of seasonality. The seasonality component specifically manifests as heightened sales during the summer months, spanning from June to August where sales are multiplied by 1.6, with a slight surge of 1.25 in May and September. The dataset captures monthly sales from the start of 2019 until the end of May 2023, providing sample data to account for trend and seasonality. Sales commence at a value of 30 on January 1, 2019, and conclude at 176 on June 30, 2023. Random stockout periods, totaling 25 periods where we stockouts are four to seven days long, were incorporated into the dataset using Python. The trend array represents a linear progression of numbers ranging from 0 to 1, and its length is determined by the number of dates generated. For the purpose of growth, the trend value is multiplied by 80. The sales figures are generated by summing the trend and the starting sales value (which is 30). 

#### After applying the first sales approximation technique "Average of last known periods", we can see a significant change in data:

#### Second sales approximation technique "Deterministic interpolation": 
I have now applied two models of deterministic interpolation: Classic polynomial interpolation and Spline interpolation: Interestingly, they both yield similar results, mostly due to the high degree of polynomials, which was determined by the loop function that I created in R (you can see more in deterministic_interpolation.R file). A higher-degree polynomial can capture local variations in the data better, making it more similar to spline interpolation, which is “local” by nature, meaning that it is designed to capture local variations by fitting separate polynomials to different segments of the data.
